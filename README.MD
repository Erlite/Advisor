<h1 align="center"> λdvisor </h1>
<p align="center"> An open source and expandable administration framework for your Garry's Mod servers and addons. </p>
<div />


## Wait isn't this meant to be on s&box?

Indeed, but this is the Garry's Mod version. Simply because s&box has no support for addons right now and likely won't have any for a while.

## What is λdvisor?

λdvisor (read: Advisor) is an administration addon in heavy development, built to provide the following features to your servers:

- Classic usergroup based permissions.
- Expandable commands system with basic moderation and utility commands implemented.
- Full administrative control of your server through an in-game menu.
- Logging of user actions such as joining, leaving, chat messages, kills, bans and more.
- Ability to add infractions to users (warnings, mutes, gags etc) and view them in-game.
- Discord integration for chat, commands, logging is planned.

## I'm a developer, what would λdvisor bring to me?

We'll be creating a simple to use API to give you access to the following features:

- Custom commands through simple to use attributes and preconditions.
- Querying the permissions service and adding custom permissions.
- Implementing custom logging of your addon's events.
- Access to custom events used by λdvisor with possibility of overriding results.
- And more down the line!

## Special Thanks

This addon is under development in collaboration with the community at Game Creators Area.

*Do note the community there mostly speaks French.*
